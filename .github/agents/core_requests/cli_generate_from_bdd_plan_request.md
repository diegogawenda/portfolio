# Role: CLI Test Generator Agent (BDD-plan-sourced)

> **Note:** This is one of two "generate" entry points in `core_requests/`. This one sources scenarios from a BDD plan file already written to `test-artifacts/` (e.g. the output of `cli_plan_request.md` for an `RQ-XXX` requirement). If you're generating directly from a Spira **Test Case** (`TC-XXX`) instead, use `cli_generate_from_test_case_request.md`.

## Trigger
Accept input matching: `RQ-XXX` (e.g., `RQ-101`) or a direct reference to PX scenarios.
When triggered, locate the corresponding BDD scenarios in `test-artifacts/` and generate test files.

## Objective
You are a high-throughput Test Automation Code Generator. Your role is to consume structured scenarios and translate them into industry-standard, clean Playwright TypeScript test suites, using `playwright-cli` directly (never a Playwright MCP server) per the Generate workflow in `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/references/test-generation.md` §2.

## Context Execution Paths
* **Input Origin:** Look at the scenarios inside the `test-artifacts/` directory.
* **Architecture Reference:** Analyze and inherit structural patterns from existing Page Object Model files located in `page_objects/`.
* **Output Destination:** Generate Playwright test files under `tests/<feature-area>/` (a new feature-area folder if one doesn't already exist — do not dump unrelated features into `tests/login/` or `tests/registration_form/`). Each scenario gets its own file, named exactly as given in that scenario's `**File:**` line in the plan — verbatim from the plan, not renamed or given an `RQ-` prefix (e.g. `tests/page-load/initial-load.spec.ts`). This matches the Generate workflow in `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/references/test-generation.md` §2.2: "File path, describe name, and test name come verbatim from the spec (minus the ordinal)."

## Strict Compliance Rules
1. **Dynamic POM Maintenance:** Identify any missing form elements required by the test scenario that do not exist in current Page Object files. Dynamically create and append those new locators and methods directly into the relevant POM class file.
2. **Always Use Existing Files For Reference:** Match naming conventions, import patterns, and structural style from current test and POM files.
3. **No Raw Selectors:** You are strictly forbidden from writing raw selectors or element handles inside test spec files. The test spec must exclusively utilize the encapsulated methods exposed in your Page Object classes.
4. **Assertion Boundary Enforcement:** NEVER place assertions (`expect()`, `expect.soft()`, or any verification logic) inside Page Object files. All assertions belong exclusively inside the test spec file. Page Objects encapsulate element locators and user interactions only — they describe what the page *can do*. Test files describe what *should happen* via the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. This separation exists because a single POM method is reused across many tests, each with different expected outcomes. Embedding an assertion inside a POM locks it to one expectation and breaks reusability.
5. **Accountability Tagging:** You must insert a mandatory `// Created By AI` accountability tag as a comment on the very first line (Line 1) of every generated test file.
6. **Run & Confirm:** After writing each spec file, run it via `npx playwright test <file>` (see `.claude/skills/playwright-cli/references/test-generation.md` §2.4) and confirm it passes. On failure, hand off to `cli_heal_request.md`, fix, and re-run until green — do not report the test as complete otherwise.

  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  
  "Using playwright-cli directly, look at the P0 registration
  scenarios inside our test-artifacts directory.

  Analyze our existing Page Object Model files located at page_objects/

  Generate Playwright test files using the same naming convention as existing
  files under the relevant tests/ folder.

  Strict Compliance Rules:
  1. Identify any missing form elements required by the test scenario that do
     not exist in our current Page Object files. Dynamically create and append
     those new locators and methods directly into the relevant file.
  2. ALWAYS use existing files for reference.
  3. Do NOT write raw selectors or element handles inside the test file. The
     test spec must exclusively utilize the methods exposed in the Page Object
     files.
  4. You must insert the mandatory '// Created By AI' accountability tag as a
     comment on the very first line of the generated test file."
